# Frontend Mentor - Expenses chart component solution

This is my solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma sketch, so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
